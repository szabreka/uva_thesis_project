**Abstarct of the thesis report:** Advanced computer vision techniques have led to the development
of various vision-based approaches to tackle the complex challenge
of smoke detection. A lightweight AI tool that can recognize poten-
tially harmful industrial emissions would aid local communities in
their fight for clean air. This thesis addresses the research gap in
the potential benefits of utilizing OpenAIâ€™s Contrastive Language-
Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for industrial smoke detection.
The proposed Vision-Language model exploits the advantages of
comparing text and image semantics. Prior research has primar-
ily utilized Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers,
and segmentation methods. This study evaluates CLIP in indus-
trial smoke detection in terms of performance and computational
efficiency. Experiments show that fully-supervised CLIP training,
particularly when utilizing linear probe representation learning,
performs better than zero-shot and few-shot setups for smoke de-
tection. Additionally, an ensemble approach, combining a fully-
supervised CLIP model with a small MobileNetV3 using a GRU
or LSTM layer outperforms the baseline Two-Stream Inflated 3D
ConvNet model with a single Timeception layer in terms of light-
weight design, as the model can be run using only CPU cores. The
ensemble model achieved an average F1 score of 0.72, indicating a
promising approach for smoke detection.
